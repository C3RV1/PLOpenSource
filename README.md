# PL Open Source

The intent of this project is to serve as an engine (or rather as a template) to build
Professor Layton games for PC. This project will already incorporate rooms, events, puzzles, and menus.
Minigames must be implemented on top of this. This project is not associated in any way with Level5.

## Build

Right now the project is built using the Makefile which comes w/ the project. We are planning on
porting it to CMake soon.

## Building assets

To build the different assets the game uses, you must use the tools under the directory "tools".
