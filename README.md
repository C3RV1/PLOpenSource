# PL Open Source

The intent of this project is to serve as an engine (or rather as a template) to build
Professor Layton games for PC. This project will already incorporate rooms, events, puzzles, and menus.
Minigames must be implemented on top of this. This project is not associated in any way with Level5.

## Build

Just use CMake on the root directory. Maybe you need to reconfigure SDL paths on CMakeLists.txt

## Building assets

To build the different assets the game uses, you must use the tools under the directory "tools".
